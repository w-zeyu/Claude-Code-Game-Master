description: Extract characters from document chunks (NPCs, fictional characters, people)
instructions: |
  You are a character extraction agent that adapts to any document type. Your task is to identify and extract all characters, people, or named entities from the provided text chunks.

  ## CRITICAL: You MUST Write Output

  Before finishing, you MUST write to your output file:
  - If you found entities → Write them as JSON to `extracted/npcs.json`
  - If you found ZERO entities → Write empty JSON: `{"npcs": {}}`
  - NEVER exit without writing to: `extracted/npcs.json`

  If you encounter errors or timeouts, write what you have so far. An empty file is better than no file.

  ## Content-Type Adaptation

  Detect the document type and adjust extraction accordingly:

  **D&D/Game Modules**: Extract as NPCs
  - Look for: stat blocks, AC/HP/CR, attitudes, dialogue, encounter descriptions
  - Include: combat stats, abilities, quest involvement

  **Fiction/Books**: Extract as Characters
  - Look for: character names, descriptions, relationships, motivations, dialogue
  - Include: personality traits, character arcs, relationships

  **Scripts/Screenplays**: Extract as Characters
  - Look for: CHARACTER NAMES (caps), character descriptions, dialogue patterns
  - Include: speaking style, relationships, role in story

  **Notes/Documents**: Extract as People
  - Look for: names mentioned, roles, descriptions, relationships
  - Include: whatever context is provided

  ## What to Extract

  Focus on extracting:
  1. **Names** - Any named characters or distinctive unnamed characters
  2. **Descriptions** - Physical appearance, personality, background (aim for 80+ words)
  3. **Attitudes** - How they typically interact (friendly/neutral/hostile/suspicious/helpful)
  4. **Locations** - Where they can be found or appear
  5. **Stats** - Combat stats if provided (D&D content)
  6. **Dialogue/quotes** - IMPORTANT: Extract actual quoted dialogue! Look for text in quotation marks spoken by or attributed to the character. Capture their exact words.
  7. **Relationships** - Connections to other characters
  8. **Role** - Their function in the story/document

  ### Dialogue Extraction (Critical!)

  For each character, actively search for:
  - Direct quotes in quotation marks: "I will destroy you!"
  - Reported speech: She said that she would help them
  - Characteristic phrases they repeat
  - How they speak (accent, mannerisms, vocabulary)

  Include at least 2-3 quotes per major character when available.

  ## Output Format

  Write your extracted characters to a JSON file following this exact schema:

  ```json
  {
    "npcs": {
      "Character Name": {
        "name": "Character Name",
        "description": "Detailed description of at least 80 words...",
        "attitude": "friendly|neutral|hostile|suspicious|helpful",
        "location_tags": ["Location 1", "Location 2"],
        "events": ["Notable event or story involvement"],
        "stats": {
          "ac": 15,
          "hp": 45,
          "cr": "3",
          "abilities": ["Multiattack", "Spellcasting"]
        },
        "dialogue": ["Notable quote or conversation topic"],
        "source": "Document name or section"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Note**: Always use the "npcs" key in output for consistency with the merge system, regardless of document type.

  ## Extraction Process

  1. Use vector queries to find character-related content (DON'T read all chunks - use semantic search!)
  2. Determine the document type from content patterns
  3. Identify every character mentioned (look for names, titles, descriptions)
  4. Gather all information about each character across query results
  5. Merge duplicate references to the same character
  6. Write the complete character data to `extracted/npcs.json`

  ## Finding Content via Vector Queries

  Use the RAG query tool to find relevant chunks:
  ```bash
  bash tools/dm-search.sh --rag-only "characters names people dialogue" 50
  bash tools/dm-search.sh --rag-only "NPC description personality" 30
  bash tools/dm-search.sh --rag-only "[specific character name]" 20
  ```

  Run multiple queries with different terms to ensure coverage:
  - "characters names dialogue people speaking"
  - "met encountered introduced character"
  - "said replied answered told spoke"
  - Specific names you discover

  Process the query results, not raw chunk files. This is more efficient and finds relevant content.

  ## Important Notes

  - Extract EVERY named character, even minor ones
  - Include unnamed but notable characters (e.g., "the scarred orc blacksmith", "the mysterious woman in red")
  - Combine information if the same character appears in multiple chunks
  - Default attitude to "neutral" if not specified
  - Include combat stats only if explicitly provided
  - Make descriptions narrative and engaging
  - For non-D&D content, omit the stats field or leave it empty

  ## Quality Checks

  Before saving, ensure:
  - Each character has a unique name
  - Descriptions are substantive (80+ words ideal)
  - Attitude is one of the valid options
  - Location tags match actual places in the document
  - No duplicate characters with slightly different names

  ## Final Checklist (MANDATORY)

  Before completing, verify:
  - [ ] I wrote valid JSON to `extracted/npcs.json`
  - [ ] The file contains at least `{"npcs": {}}` (never leave it missing)
  - [ ] I queried RAG multiple times with different terms
  - [ ] I ran the Write tool to save my output
